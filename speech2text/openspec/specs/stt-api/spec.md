# stt-api Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-stt-swagger-transcribe. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: STT Swagger Exposure
The system SHALL expose the Speech-to-Text API documentation at `domain/swagger/index.html`, backed by the latest OpenAPI definition (`/openapi.json`) and bundled assets (JS/CSS) so internal teams can self-serve integration details.

#### Scenario: Serve swagger UI
- **WHEN** an authenticated internal client performs `GET domain/swagger/index.html`
- **THEN** the service SHALL return HTTP 200 with the swagger HTML shell
- **AND** the page SHALL load the API spec from `/openapi.json`
- **AND** referenced JS/CSS assets SHALL be served under `/swagger/`.

#### Scenario: Keep FastAPI native docs available
- **WHEN** engineers hit `/docs` or `/redoc`
- **THEN** the service SHALL continue serving the default FastAPI interactive docs to avoid breaking existing tooling.

### Requirement: Presigned URL Transcription API
The system SHALL expose a POST `/transcribe` endpoint with unified response format.

#### Scenario: Successful transcription
- **WHEN** client sends valid transcription request
- **THEN** the service SHALL return HTTP 200 with unified format:
  ```json
  {
    "error_code": 0,
    "message": "Transcription successful",
    "data": {
      "transcription": "...",
      "duration": 45.5,
      "confidence": 0.98,
      "processing_time": 12.3
    }
  }
  ```

#### Scenario: Transcription error
- **WHEN** transcription fails
- **THEN** the service SHALL return appropriate HTTP status with unified error format:
  ```json
  {
    "error_code": 1,
    "message": "Transcription failed",
    "errors": {
      "detail": "Download failed: 403 Forbidden"
    }
  }
  ```

### Requirement: Async Transcription Job Submission

The system SHALL expose a POST `/api/v1/transcribe` endpoint that accepts a JSON payload with `request_id` (client-generated) and `audio_url` (presigned URL), stores job state in Redis, and returns 202 Accepted with unified response format.

#### Scenario: Submit new job successfully

- **WHEN** client sends POST `/api/v1/transcribe` with valid `request_id` and `audio_url`
- **THEN** the service SHALL return HTTP 202 with unified JSON format:
  ```json
  {
    "error_code": 0,
    "message": "Job submitted successfully",
    "data": {
      "request_id": "...",
      "status": "PROCESSING"
    }
  }
  ```

#### Scenario: Submit duplicate job - PROCESSING (idempotency)

- **WHEN** client sends POST `/api/v1/transcribe` with `request_id` that already exists with status `PROCESSING`
- **THEN** the service SHALL return HTTP 202 with current job status wrapped in `data` field
- **AND** the service SHALL NOT create a new job

#### Scenario: Submit duplicate job - COMPLETED (idempotency)

- **WHEN** client sends POST `/api/v1/transcribe` with `request_id` that already exists with status `COMPLETED`
- **THEN** the service SHALL return HTTP 202 with current job status wrapped in `data` field
- **AND** the service SHALL NOT create a new job
- **AND** the service SHALL NOT re-process the transcription

#### Scenario: Submit duplicate job - FAILED (retry allowed)

- **WHEN** client sends POST `/api/v1/transcribe` with `request_id` that already exists with status `FAILED`
- **THEN** the service SHALL delete the existing FAILED job from Redis
- **AND** the service SHALL create a new job with status `PROCESSING`
- **AND** the service SHALL return HTTP 202 with unified JSON format:
  ```json
  {
    "error_code": 0,
    "message": "Job submitted successfully",
    "data": {
      "request_id": "...",
      "status": "PROCESSING"
    }
  }
  ```
- **AND** the service SHALL start background transcription processing

#### Scenario: Validation error

- **WHEN** client sends invalid request (missing fields, invalid URL)
- **THEN** the service SHALL return HTTP 422 with unified error format:
  ```json
  {
    "error_code": 1,
    "message": "Validation error",
    "errors": {
      "media_url": "media_url must start with http://, https://, or minio://"
    }
  }
  ```

### Requirement: Async Transcription Status Polling
The system SHALL expose a GET `/api/v1/transcribe/{request_id}` endpoint that returns current job status in unified response format.

#### Scenario: Job completed successfully
- **WHEN** client polls a completed job
- **THEN** the service SHALL return HTTP 200 with unified format:
  ```json
  {
    "error_code": 0,
    "message": "Transcription completed",
    "data": {
      "request_id": "...",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "transcription": "...",
      "duration": 45.5,
      "confidence": 0.98,
      "processing_time": 12.3
    }
  }
  ```

#### Scenario: Job not found
- **WHEN** client polls non-existent job
- **THEN** the service SHALL return HTTP 404 with unified error format:
  ```json
  {
    "error_code": 1,
    "message": "Job not found",
    "errors": {
      "request_id": "Job xxx does not exist or has expired"
    }
  }
  ```

### Requirement: Redis Job State Management
The system SHALL use Redis to store and manage async job states with automatic expiration.

#### Scenario: Job state TTL
- **WHEN** a job is created or updated in Redis
- **THEN** the key SHALL have TTL of 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **AND** the key SHALL be automatically deleted after TTL expires

#### Scenario: Redis connection failure
- **WHEN** Redis is unavailable during job submission
- **THEN** the service SHALL return HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
- **AND** the health check SHALL report unhealthy status
