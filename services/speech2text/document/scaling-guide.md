## Overview

The STT service can be scaled in two ways:

| Strategy               | Description                 | When to Use                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Vertical Scaling**   | Increase CPU/Memory per pod | Single request latency too high |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Increase number of pods     | System throughput too low       |

### Key Metrics

- **Latency**: Time to process a single request (ms)
- **RPS**: Requests per second (throughput)
- **RTF**: Real-Time Factor (processing_time / audio_duration)
- **CPU Utilization**: Percentage of allocated CPU used
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption per pod

## Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)

### When to Scale Vertically

Use vertical scaling when:

1. **Single request latency exceeds SLA**
   - Current latency > target latency
   - CPU utilization < 70% (room for more cores)
2. **CPU scaling efficiency is good**

   - Efficiency > 70% at target core count
   - Linear or sub-linear scaling observed

3. **Memory is sufficient**
   - Peak memory < 80% of allocated
   - No OOM events

### How to Scale Vertically

#### Increase CPU

```yaml
# k8s/deployment.yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "2.5" # Increase from current
    memory: "2Gi"
  limits:
    cpu: "4" # Increase proportionally
    memory: "4Gi"
```

**Expected Impact:**

- 2.5 → 4 cores: ~40% latency reduction (if efficiency > 70%)
- Cost increase: ~60% per pod

#### Increase Memory

Only increase memory if:

- Processing large audio files (>10 minutes)
- OOM errors observed
- Using larger models (medium, large)

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "4Gi" # Increase for larger models
  limits:
    memory: "6Gi"
```

### Thread Tuning

Optimize `WHISPER_N_THREADS` based on CPU allocation:

| CPU Cores | Recommended Threads | Notes                        |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1         | 1                   | Avoid over-subscription      |
| 2         | 2                   | Match core count             |
| 4         | 4                   | Optimal for most workloads   |
| 8+        | 4-6                 | Diminishing returns beyond 4 |

```yaml
env:
  - name: WHISPER_N_THREADS
    value: "4"
```

## Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)

### When to Scale Horizontally

Use horizontal scaling when:

1. **System throughput is insufficient**
   - Total RPS < demand
   - Request queue building up
2. **CPU utilization is high across all pods**

   - Average CPU > 70%
   - All pods are busy

3. **Vertical scaling has diminishing returns**
   - Efficiency < 50% at current core count
   - Cost per performance is poor

### How to Scale Horizontally

#### Manual Scaling

```bash
kubectl scale deployment stt-api --replicas=5
```

#### HPA Configuration

```yaml
# k8s/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: stt-api-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: stt-api
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
  behavior:
    scaleUp:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
      policies:
        - type: Pods
          value: 2
          periodSeconds: 60
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
      policies:
        - type: Pods
          value: 1
          periodSeconds: 120
```

### Capacity Planning

Calculate required pods:

```
Required Pods = Target RPS / RPS per Pod

Example:
- Target: 10 RPS
- Single pod RPS: 2 RPS
- Required pods: 10 / 2 = 5 pods
```

## Decision Matrix

### Scaling Decision Flowchart

```
Is single request latency too high?
├── YES → Check CPU efficiency
│         ├── Efficiency > 70% → Vertical Scale (add CPU)
│         └── Efficiency < 70% → Consider smaller model or optimize
│
└── NO → Is system throughput too low?
          ├── YES → Check CPU utilization
          │         ├── CPU > 70% → Horizontal Scale (add pods)
          │         └── CPU < 70% → Check for bottlenecks
          │
          └── NO → System is healthy ✓
```

### Prometheus Alerts

```yaml
groups:
  - name: stt-scaling
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUtilization
        expr: avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod=~"stt-api.*"}[5m])) > 0.7
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU utilization - consider scaling"

      - alert: HighLatency
        expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{path="/transcribe"}[5m])) > 2
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High request latency - consider scaling"
```

## Cost Optimization

### Cost vs Performance Trade-offs

| Configuration  | Cost  | Latency | Throughput | Use Case                   |
| -------------- | ----- | ------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| 2 pods × 2 CPU | $$    | Medium  | Low        | Development                |
| 2 pods × 4 CPU | $$$   | Low     | Low        | Low traffic, fast response |
| 4 pods × 2 CPU | $$$$  | Medium  | Medium     | Balanced                   |
| 4 pods × 4 CPU | $$$$$ | Low     | High       | Production                 |

### Recommendations by Traffic Level

| Daily Requests  | Recommended Config    | Estimated Cost |
| --------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| < 1,000         | 2 pods × 2 CPU        | $              |
| 1,000 - 10,000  | 2 pods × 4 CPU        | $$             |
| 10,000 - 50,000 | 4 pods × 4 CPU        | $$$            |
| > 50,000        | 8+ pods × 4 CPU + HPA | $$$$           |

### Cost Saving Tips

1. **Use HPA with conservative settings**

   - Scale down slowly (5 min stabilization)
   - Scale up quickly (1 min stabilization)

2. **Right-size resources**

   - Start small, scale based on metrics
   - Review and adjust monthly

3. **Use spot/preemptible instances**
   - For non-critical workloads
   - With proper pod disruption budgets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High Latency Despite Low CPU

**Possible causes:**

- Thread contention (too many threads)
- Memory pressure (swapping)
- I/O bottleneck (audio download)

**Solutions:**

1. Reduce `WHISPER_N_THREADS`
2. Increase memory allocation
3. Check network latency to audio sources

#### Pods Not Scaling

**Possible causes:**

- HPA metrics not available
- Resource limits too low
- Cluster capacity exhausted

**Solutions:**

1. Verify metrics-server is running
2. Check HPA status: `kubectl describe hpa stt-api-hpa`
3. Check cluster capacity: `kubectl describe nodes`

#### Uneven Load Distribution

**Possible causes:**

- Sticky sessions enabled
- Long-running requests
- Pod startup time

**Solutions:**

1. Disable session affinity
2. Implement request timeouts
3. Use readiness probes

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check HPA status
kubectl get hpa stt-api-hpa

# Check pod resource usage
kubectl top pods -l app=stt-api

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs -l app=stt-api --tail=100

# Describe deployment
kubectl describe deployment stt-api
```
