## 1. Capability & Design Alignment

- [x] **Task 1.1**: Align orchestrator design with master proposal and implement_plan

  - [x] Reconciled `analytic_orchestrator.md`, `documents/implement_plan.md` (Phase 1 & 2),
        and `documents/master-proposal.md` (Sections 3 & 4) to: - Confirm the exact 5-stage pipeline (Preprocessor → Intent → Keyword → Sentiment → Impact)
        as the canonical processing order. - Clarify Atomic JSON input contract with sections: `meta`, `content`, `interaction`,
        `author`, `comments`, consistent with the MinIO JSON schema. - Confirm final DB (`post_analytics`) and API output contracts, reusing the schema and
        response examples already defined in `documents/master-proposal.md`.
  - [x] Captured the orchestrator role, input/output contracts, skip behavior and entry-point
        integration explicitly in `openspec/changes/analytic_orchestrator/design.md`.

- [x] **Task 1.2**: Define orchestration capability spec
  - [x] Added delta spec under `openspec/changes/analytic_orchestrator/specs/service_lifecycle/spec.md`
        defining: - Orchestrator responsibility and boundaries (single-post pipeline runner). - Entry points (queue consumer with MinIO, dev/test API with direct JSON). - Persistence contract to `post_analytics` via enriched analytics payload.
  - [x] Ensured requirements include: - Single-post processing semantics (Atomic JSON in, one analytics record out). - Skip logic for SPAM/SEEDING/noise with neutral/LOW defaults when skipped. - Deterministic, side-effect free module ordering (Preprocessor → Intent → Keyword
        → Sentiment → Impact) as a core invariant.

## 2. Core Orchestrator Implementation

- [x] **Task 2.1**: Implement `AnalyticsOrchestrator` class

  - [x] Created `services/analytics/orchestrator.py` with an `AnalyticsOrchestrator` that: - Accepts `post_data: dict` (Atomic JSON) and returns a final analytics dict. - Holds references to module instances: - `TextPreprocessor` - `IntentClassifier` - `KeywordExtractor` - `SentimentAnalyzer` (optional, to allow disabling sentiment layer in some envs). - `ImpactCalculator` - Uses a repository abstraction for persistence via a simple `save(dict)` call.
  - [x] Implemented `process_post(post_data: dict) -> dict` to: - Extract core fields from `meta`, `interaction`, `author`, `comments`. - Run Modules 1–5 sequentially, respecting existing I/O contracts from each module. - Apply skip logic combining preprocessor stats (e.g. `is_too_short`,
        `has_spam_keyword`) and intent result (`should_skip`) to short-circuit noisy posts. - Build final analytics payloads: - `_build_skipped_result(...)` for skipped posts with neutral/LOW defaults. - `_build_final_result(...)` for fully processed posts, compatible with
        `PostAnalytics` and aligned with `documents/master-proposal.md` output examples.

- [x] **Task 2.2**: Implement skip & fallback strategies
  - [x] Defined an internal `_build_skipped_result(...)` helper that: - Marks posts as skipped but still records essential metadata (intent). - Sets neutral defaults for sentiment/impact (NEUTRAL sentiment, LOW risk,
        zero impact score) while preserving raw engagement metrics.
  - [x] Ensured orchestrator can gracefully handle: - Missing or partial `interaction` / `author` metrics via `.get(..., 0)` access. - Missing `comments` array using safe defaults in `_run_preprocessor`. - Partial module failures by: - Wrapping keyword extraction in `_run_keywords` and falling back to an
        empty `KeywordResult` when extraction fails. - Wrapping sentiment analysis in `_run_sentiment` and falling back to
        a neutral overall result with empty aspects on error or when the
        analyzer is not configured. - Wrapping impact calculation in `_run_impact` and falling back to a
        neutral/LOW impact result with zeroed breakdown when calculation fails,
        so a consistent record can still be persisted.

## 3. Infrastructure Adapters & Repository

- [x] **Task 3.1**: MinIO storage adapter

  - [x] Implemented `infrastructure/storage/minio_client.py` with a `MinioAdapter` that: - Wraps the `minio` client using `core.config.Settings` (`minio_endpoint`,
        `minio_access_key`, `minio_secret_key`) for credentials and secure flag. - Provides `download_json(bucket: str, object_path: str) -> dict` that: - Streams object content from MinIO via `get_object`. - Parses JSON directly from the response stream into a Python dict
        without writing temporary files. - Logs success/failure via `core.logger` and raises a `RuntimeError` with a clear
        message when fetching or parsing fails, so callers (consumer/orchestrator)
        can handle errors appropriately.

- [x] **Task 3.2**: Analytics repository
  - [x] Implemented `repository/analytics_repository.py` with an `AnalyticsRepository` that: - Accepts a synchronous SQLAlchemy `Session` in its constructor. - Provides `save(analytics_data: dict)` to persist into `models.PostAnalytics`,
        performing an insert-or-update based on the primary key `id` so
        re-processing the same post overwrites the previous analytics record. - Provides `get_by_id(post_id: str)` to fetch existing `PostAnalytics` rows.
  - [x] Ensured mapping between orchestrator payload and `PostAnalytics` fields is explicit
        and aligned: - `impact_score`, `risk_level`, `is_viral`, `is_kol`. - `aspects_breakdown`, `keywords`, `sentiment_probabilities`, `impact_breakdown`. - Raw metrics (view/like/comment/share/save/follower counts), timestamps and
        core identifiers (`id`, `project_id`, `platform`, `published_at`, `analyzed_at`).

## 4. Entry Points (Queue & API)

- [x] **Task 4.1**: RabbitMQ consumer integration

  - [x] Extended `internal/consumers/main.py` to: - Parse incoming messages as either: - A full Atomic JSON post (`post_data`), or - An envelope containing `data_ref` (`bucket`, `path`) pointing to a
        MinIO object. - Use `MinioAdapter` (`infrastructure/storage/minio_client.py`) to load
        the Atomic JSON from MinIO when `data_ref` is present. - Create a DB session via a local SQLAlchemy session factory using
        `settings.database_url_sync` and `models.database.Base`. - Instantiate `AnalyticsRepository` with the DB session and
        `AnalyticsOrchestrator` with that repository (and a `SentimentAnalyzer`
        built from the provided PhoBERT model when available). - Delegate all per-post processing to `AnalyticsOrchestrator.process_post(post_data)`
        and log success/failure, relying on `aio_pika` context for ack/nack semantics.
  - [x] Ensured the consumer no longer duplicates pipeline/module logic (keyword,
        sentiment, impact) and instead treats the orchestrator as the single
        entry point for analytics decisions.

- [x] **Task 4.2**: Dev/Test API endpoint
  - [x] Added a dev/test-only route under `internal/api/routes/orchestrator.py` that: - Defines an `OrchestratorRequest` model matching the Atomic JSON structure
        (`meta`, `content`, `interaction`, `author`, `comments`). - Exposes `POST /dev/process-post-direct` which: - Accepts a full Atomic JSON post body. - Creates a synchronous DB session and `AnalyticsRepository`. - Optionally builds a `SentimentAnalyzer` from a best-effort `PhoBERTONNX`
        instance for local testing. - Delegates to `AnalyticsOrchestrator.process_post(post_data)` and returns
        the final analytics result wrapped in a simple `status` + `data` response. - Registers the router in `internal/api/main.py` under the `/dev` prefix to
        clearly indicate it bypasses MinIO and queue and is intended for
        debugging/development only.

## 5. Testing & Validation

- [x] **Task 5.1**: Unit tests for orchestrator

  - [x] Added `tests/orchestrator/test_unit.py` with comprehensive test coverage: - **Happy-path orchestration**: `TestHappyPath` class with tests for full pipeline success
        and complete metrics handling (all modules succeed, result persisted correctly). - **Skip logic**: `TestSkipLogic` class covering: - Skip for too-short text (`is_too_short` flag). - Skip for spam keywords (`has_spam_keyword` flag). - Skip for SEEDING intent (`should_skip` from intent classifier). - Combination of spam + intent skip conditions (OR logic). - **Graceful handling**: `TestGracefulHandling` class covering: - Missing interaction metrics (defaults to 0). - Missing author metrics (defaults to 0). - Missing comments (empty list handled). - Missing content text (empty content handled). - Missing SentimentAnalyzer (returns neutral defaults). - Keyword extraction failures (graceful fallback to empty keywords). - Impact calculation failures (graceful fallback to neutral/low impact). - **Data mapping**: `TestDataMapping` class covering: - Platform normalization to uppercase. - Unknown platform defaulting to "UNKNOWN". - Aspects breakdown mapping from sentiment result.
  - [x] Used fakes/mocks for all dependencies: - `FakeRepository`: Simple in-memory storage for verification. - `FakeTextPreprocessor`: Configurable preprocessing results. - `FakeIntentClassifier`: Configurable intent classification. - `FakeKeywordExtractor`: Configurable keyword extraction. - `FakeSentimentAnalyzer`: Configurable sentiment analysis. - `FakeImpactCalculator`: Configurable impact calculation. - All tests run fast (<5 seconds) without loading real models or databases.

- [x] **Task 5.2**: Integration tests (API & consumer)
  - [x] Added API integration coverage in `tests/integration/test_api_integration.py`: - Extended tests to cover the dev orchestrator endpoint: - `test_dev_orchestrator_endpoint_runs_full_pipeline` posts a full Atomic JSON
        to `POST /dev/process-post-direct`, asserts a `SUCCESS` response and verifies
        that a patched `AnalyticsRepository` receives a `PostAnalytics`-shaped payload
        (id, project_id, platform, impact_score, risk_level). - Reused existing tests for `/health`, `/` root, `/openapi.json`, and
        `/test/analytics` to ensure the API surface remains consistent.
  - [x] Added consumer integration coverage in `tests/integration/test_consumer_integration.py`: - `test_consumer_processes_minio_ref_and_calls_repository`: - Patches `MinioAdapter` to return a sample Atomic JSON post for any
        `data_ref` (bucket/path) input. - Patches `AnalyticsRepository` to an in-memory fake and `IntentClassifier`
        inside `services.analytics.orchestrator` to return a dict-based result
        compatible with orchestrator skip logic. - Constructs a synthetic RabbitMQ `IncomingMessage`-like object and invokes
        the async message handler returned by `create_message_handler`. - Asserts that the fake repository is called exactly once with a payload
        containing the expected `id`, normalized `platform`, `impact_score`,
        and `risk_level`, demonstrating an end-to-end orchestrated run without
        requiring a real database, RabbitMQ, or MinIO instance.

## 6. Documentation & OpenSpec Validation

- [x] **Task 6.1**: Documentation updates

  - [x] Updated `documents/architecture.md` to include a dedicated subsection: - **`7.1 Analytics Orchestrator (services/analytics/orchestrator.py)`** describing: - The orchestrator's role as the central coordinator for the 5-module pipeline
        (Preprocessor → Intent → Keyword → Sentiment → Impact → Persistence). - The two entry points: - RabbitMQ consumer (`internal/consumers/main.py`) using `MinioAdapter` to load
        Atomic JSON from MinIO and delegating to `AnalyticsOrchestrator.process_post`. - Dev/Test API endpoint (`internal/api/routes/orchestrator.py`, `POST /dev/process-post-direct`)
        that accepts Atomic JSON directly and calls the orchestrator for debugging. - A text diagram showing the end-to-end flow: - MinIO → Consumer → Orchestrator → Repository → PostgreSQL. - Dev/Test API → Orchestrator → Repository → PostgreSQL.

- [x] **Task 6.2**: OpenSpec validation
  - [x] Ran `openspec validate analytic_orchestrator --strict` and confirmed the change is valid.
  - [x] Verified that existing spec deltas under
        `openspec/changes/analytic_orchestrator/specs/service_lifecycle/spec.md` already
        describe orchestrator behavior and entry points accurately, so no additional
        spec edits were required for this task.
